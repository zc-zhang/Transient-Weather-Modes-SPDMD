# Koopman-Mode-Decomposition (KMD)
Computation of weather data by means of Koopman mode decomposition (KMD) and its variants. Koopman mode decompostion is an appearing data-driven technique to investigate the complex and nonlinear systems.
Koopman operator theory provides the spectral analysis for the nonlinear behaviors by lifting the nonlinear dynamics into an infinite dimensional but linear system, which acts on the space of the observable functions.
